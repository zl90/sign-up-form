# sign-up-form
My submission for the Sign-up Form assignment on the Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form 

## The problem solving process

**Overview**

I'll be building a sign-up form for an imaginary service. The goal is to practice the concepts I've been learning in the 'Intermediate HTML and CSS' portion of the Odin Project. I aim to include some implementation of all of the following concepts:

    - HTML Forms.
    - Form validation.
    - Overriding default CSS styles.
    - Advanced selectors.
    - Positioning.
        - Absolute positioning.
    - CSS functions.
        - calc().
        - clamp().
    - Basic responsiveness for mobile browsers.
    - Custom CSS properties.

**Tech used**

- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- Meyer CSS reset: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/

**Planning**

I'll be applying a dark theme to the page, with purple colour scattered throughout. I've selected an image of a neon cityscape which reflects the colour scheme I'm aiming for.

I'll be experimenting with responsiveness using media queries, something I've rarely done before. I will sketch out two layouts: one for mobile and one for desktop. The desktop layout should include a background image. The mobile layout will exclude the background image and the form controls will collapse into one column for better readability.

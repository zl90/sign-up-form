This project was created for the [Sign-Up Form assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css/lessons/sign-up-form) as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. I met all the assignment objectives and then expanded on it with my own colour scheme and added mobile responsiveness.

This form uses simple HTML validation as per the project requirements. It utilizes the `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo-classes to provide feedback to the user.

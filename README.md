# sign-up-form
My submission for the Sign-up Form assignment on the Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

I'll be building a sign-up form for an imaginary service. The goal is to practice the concepts I've been learning in the 'Intermediate HTML and CSS' portion of the Odin Project. I aim to include some implementation of all of the following concepts:
    - HTML Forms.
    - Form validation.
    - Overriding default CSS styles.
    - Advanced selectors.
    - Positioning.
        - Absolute positioning.
    - CSS functions.
        - calc().
        - clamp().
    - Basic responsiveness for mobile browsers.
    - Custom CSS properties.
